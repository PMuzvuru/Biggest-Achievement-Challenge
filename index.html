        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          As a matriculant at Hout Bay High School, I achieved four A’s, one B,
          and two C’s for my final matric results, despite facing difficult
          personal circumstances. My hard work and determination paid off as I
          scored high marks in my finals. I was honored at a provincial
          education department awards ceremony for excelling under these
          challenging conditions. On Tuesday, February 28 2023, I received an
          award from the Western Cape Education Department’s Metro Central
          Education District for my achievements. Throughout my high school
          years, I actively participated in many school programs and clubs,
          which further enriched my educational journey.

        <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          As the mother of an 18-month-old son (at the time), my matric year was far from
          easy. The challenge of balancing school and motherhood left me
          constantly busy and with little time to study. My family circumstances
          added to the difficulty, with my father living in a different country
          and my mother working hard to support us. Living with extended family
          in a cramped, one-room space made finding a quiet place to study
          nearly impossible. Often, when I tried to focus on my books, my son
          would become restless. This meant I had to wait until late at night,
          when he was asleep, to get any studying done. Despite these tough
          times, I am deeply grateful for the support of my school principal,
          who provided a quiet and safe study space for matriculants.
